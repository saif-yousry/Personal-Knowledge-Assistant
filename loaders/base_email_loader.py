"""
base_email_loader.py

Abstract base class defining the contract every email loader in the RAG
ingestion pipeline must follow.

Single Responsibility Principle
--------------------------------
An EmailLoader is responsible ONLY for:
    1. Connecting to an email provider / service.
    2. Fetching raw emails and converting them into `Email` model objects.
    3. Disconnecting and releasing any held resources.

It must NEVER perform:
    - Text cleaning / normalization
    - Chunking
    - Embedding generation
    - Vector database storage
    - Retrieval / querying

Data flow contract:
    Email Server  --(EmailLoader)-->  List[Email]

Downstream RAG pipeline stages (cleaning, chunking, embedding, storage,
retrieval) consume the `List[Email]` this loader returns; they are
implemented elsewhere and are out of scope for this class.
